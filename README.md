In this study, we aimed to generate a high-resolution terrain model with remote sensing techniques. We accomplished this by mosaicking satellite data from multiple sources to develop an initial digital terrain model (DTM), which was subsequently refined with up-to-date vertical deformation information (Julzarika, 2021) (Fig. 2-7). The initial DTM served as the initial guide in producing the remote-sensing-based DTM (Julzarika et al., 2021a). The process began with the generation of an electronic surface model (DSM), customized according to the provided input data type—e.g., satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data, aerial photographs, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (Rucci et al., 2012), stereo images, interferometry, LiDAR, videogrammetry, terrestrial surveys, or other sensor-based mapping data. Therefore, the accuracy and precision of the DSM were always undermined by the quality of these input sources (Julzarika et al., 2021b; Julzarika & Harintaka, 2019) and needed to employ several methods of DSM extraction suitable for each category of data.
We used a stereo model technique in this research to obtain digital surface models (DSMs) from PlanetScope, WorldView-2, and Sentinel-1 images taken on specific dates with different spatial resolutions (Table 2-1). PlanetScope has eight multispectral bands, and WorldView-2 has three or eight bands. Sentinel-1 data consist of single-look complex (SLC) level. We produced two DTMs from PlanetScope and WorldView-2 images, and the main DTM was derived by combining them. From synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, vertical deformation data, representing uplift or subsidence, was also derived by applying the Differential Interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) technique (Julzarika et al., 2021a). D-InSAR outputs represent the line-of-sight (LoS) vertical movement. To attain accurate vertical deformation, we calibrated LoS measurements into true vertical deformation (Suhadha et al., 2022), i.e., the final output of remote-sensing-based DTM.

Then, as part of determining the topography, we used reference points for the precise georeferencing and referencing of the remote-sensing-derived DTM into the local coordinate system (JGD 2011) in order to correctly represent the space (Bruinsma et al., 2012; Jurjević et al., 2021). Nine control points were employed for this study, which were all electronic and first-class control points of GSI (GSI, 2023) designated with official GSI codes, as presented in Fig. 2-8. The main application of the elevation data from these points was to find the height reference of the studied watersheds of Japan's Niigata Prefecture. To perform interpolations of elevation values between these nine reference points, we applied the Kriging method (Hengl et al., 2007). These data sources and methods were chosen with particular care based on their suitability to represent the terrain properties and vertical deformation patterns of the studied region, ensuring the reliability and stability of the resulting remote-sensing-derived DTM.
