In this study, we aimed to generate a high-resolution terrain model with remote sensing techniques. We accomplished this by mosaicking satellite data from multiple sources to develop an initial digital terrain model (DTM), which was subsequently refined with up-to-date vertical deformation information (Julzarika, 2021) (Fig. 2-7). The initial DTM served as the initial guide in producing the remote-sensing-based DTM (Julzarika et al., 2021a). The process began with the generation of an electronic surface model (DSM), customized according to the provided input data type—e.g., satellite imagery, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data, aerial photographs, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (Rucci et al., 2012), stereo images, interferometry, LiDAR, videogrammetry, terrestrial surveys, or other sensor-based mapping data. Therefore, the accuracy and precision of the DSM were always undermined by the quality of these input sources (Julzarika et al., 2021b; Julzarika & Harintaka, 2019) and needed to employ several methods of DSM extraction suitable for each category of data.
