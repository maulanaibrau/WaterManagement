As part of the topographic modeling process, we incorporated reference pointsâ€”particularly those derived from LiDAR data registered in the local coordinate system (JGD2011). This ensures that the modeled topographic surface aligns exactly with the LiDAR-based ground truth, which is the correction baseline. To ascertain the sensitivity of elevation accuracy to the number of reference points used, we computed the average elevation error using varying numbers of reference points: 3, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 250. The purpose of this test was to determine the minimum number of reference points that would be necessary for stable vertical adjustment, in addition to understanding the spatial patterns of error across the study area.
