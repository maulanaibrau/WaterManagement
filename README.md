The RS-DTM was developed on the basis of various numbers of reference points, and the corresponding mean absolute error (MAE) or height differences are presented in Figure XX. By using three reference points alone, although they were distributed over the study area, the height differences were mostly over 30 cm. The error kept on reducing gradually with an increase in the number of reference points. Our results indicate that relatively large differences in height occur primarily for mountainous terrain. The graphical depiction of terrain accuracy indicated that the MAE values approached a saturation level, where they leveled off at around 0.16 when 50 reference points were used (Figure XX). Based on these findings, 50 reference points were employed here. Under actual conditions, mountainous terrain still remained difficult to fully constrain, with the residual errors amounting to roughly 0.1â€“0.2 m. Thus, when obtaining field reference points for future studies, for efficiency, it is recommended to prefer reference points in plane areas such as paddy fields.

For the Tokamachi study area, RS-DTM and survey-based LiDAR datasets were established, while GSI LiDAR data were also prepared. The corresponding surface features and cross-sectional profiles are presented in the following figure.
