Flood modeling in rural, mountainous, or steep-slope terrain is difficult due to the complex terrain and microtopography that govern surface runoff processes. Steep cropland, and terrace rice fields specifically, plays a crucial role in regulating runoff and mitigating flood risk through its function as distributed retention and conveyance systems. However, accurately modeling hydrological processes in these landscapes requires detailed representation of the topographic features, especially the numerous small channels that regulate flow within the areas.

While traditional flood models rely on simplifying assumptions of channel geometry, which may be derived from empirical relationships of channel width, depth, and contributing area, such assumptions are inadequate for capturing the flow dynamics of steep landscapes. Overgeneralization of channel properties may lead to underestimation of flood peak timing, extent, and localized inundation. Therefore, acquiring precise elevation and channel geometry data is essential to develop physically based flood models for such systems.

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are fundamental datasets for flood modeling. Open-access DEMs such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, and ALOS PALSAR are easily accessible but have low resolutions that limit their application in complex, steep terrains. High-resolution elevation data from UAV-based LiDAR or ground surveys offer the required accuracy but are typically infeasible due to their exorbitant cost and logistical constraints, particularly over large and inaccessible rural landscapes

Remote sensing-based DTMs (RS-DTMs), derived from satellite data, provide a hopeful way to fill this understanding gap. They have the potential to deliver extensive area coverage and high-resolution terrain modeling with significantly reduced fieldwork input. The effectiveness of RS-DTMs has already been demonstrated in current studies on lowland flood modeling (Rau et al., 2024). Their potential to capture small-scale hydrological details, i.e., narrow irrigation and drainage ditches in sloping cropland, remains almost unexplored territory.


The study aimed to verify the applicability of high-resolution RS-DTMs to flood simulation in steep-slope farmland on the basis of their ability to capture fine-scale channel geometry and hydrologic characteristics. A comparison among RS-DTMs, publicly available LiDAR data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), and very accurate UAV-based LiDAR data, which serves as a reference, is conducted. By focusing on the representation of channel cross-sectional profiles and their implications for surface runoff simulation, this research seeks to advance the use of satellite-derived terrain data toward more robust and scalable flood modeling in complex mountainous topography
