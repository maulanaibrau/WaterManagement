For terrain analysis, satellite-based DTMs and GSI LiDAR data cross-sectional and longitudinal profiles were compared with the survey-based LiDAR DTM, the latter of which was utilized as the reference dataset. Statistical criteria were selected to measure channel-specific attributes: mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as error measures, and the coefficient of determination (R²) and RMSE as geometric surface accuracy performance metrics. Reproduction of channel parameters—bed elevation, longitudinal profiles, and cross-sectional geometry—were the primary concerns because these are of prime importance for adequate hydrologic representation.

Flood performance of the model was evaluated in terms of the channel attributes using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and RMSE. The output of model runs taken into consideration was discharge hydrographs at the downstream channel outlet, water levels in the principal channel, peak water level longitudinal profiles throughout the channel, extent maps of the inundation of the flood, total volume of the flood inundation, and peak inundation area.

For the terrain evaluation, longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles were assessed by comparing the satellite-based DTMs and GSI LiDAR data against the survey-based LiDAR DTM, which was treated as the reference dataset. Statistical measures were selected to address channel-specific characteristics: mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used as error metrics, while the coefficient of determination (R²) and RMSE were applied as performance indicators for geometric surface accuracy. The primary emphasis was placed on the reproducibility of channel parameters—such as bed elevation, longitudinal profiles, and cross-sectional geometry—which are critical for accurately representing hydrologic behavior.

Flood model performance was evaluated with respect to channel characteristics using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and RMSE. Model outputs analyzed included discharge hydrographs at the downstream channel outlet, water levels within the main channel, maximum water level profiles along the channel longitudinal section, flood inundation extent maps, flood inundation volume, and inundation area at peak time.
