Discussion

The technical and contextual reasons contributing to the superior or comparable performance of RS-DTM over GSI-based LiDAR are evident. In the cross-sectional analysis, the RS-DTM performance was quite consistent regarding correlation and efficiency, as seen from R² > 0.9 and NSE > 0.9 for river width ≤3 m. However, compared to the MAE in GSI-based LiDAR, the MAE in RS-DTM was a little higher at 0.98–1.33 m, indicating localized vertical deviations or outliers. These are very much due to noise in small channels of 0.5–1 m wide, influenced by vegetation coverage and surface roughness. Since the RS-DTM data are from June 2022, when the vegetation cover was dense, canopy interference and mixed-pixel effects might have introduced vertical bias. On the other hand, the reference LiDAR survey was in November 2024, when low vegetation conditions prevailed and produced clearer ground detection.

In the 1–2 m width of the river, RS-DTM presented significantly higher RMSE, up to 4.76 m in the longitudinal profile, while the R² remained very high at 0.97. This behavior indicates the existence of various outlier points that are probably isolated elevation anomalies due to water surface reflection, shadowed pixels, or local interpolation effects during terrain extraction. These few anomalies increase RMSE strongly while the overall correlation is not degraded, showing clearly that most of the data points fit well while a few show sharp deviation.

For the wider channels of between 3 and 5 m, both cross-sectional and longitudinal results showed a loss in accuracy: R² = 0.79 and 0.61; NSE = 0.65 and 0.38, respectively. This corresponds to partial detection of the bathymetric terrain with the SDB method. The SDB technique works where optical penetration is sufficient, which generally corresponds to channels of around 3 m wide but breaks down in cases of deeper water and increased turbidity. Thus, the RS-DTM captured submerged topographic variation not represented by the GSI-based LiDAR data.

However, these differences are not directly comparable since both the GSI-based LiDAR and the survey LiDAR datasets represent only terrain up to the water surface, without any bathymetric information. In contrast, the RS-DTM includes subsurface elevation from spectral reflectance that is less precise but extends terrain representation below the water surface. Thus, part of the apparent "error" in fact reflects additional topographic detail in the RS-DTM rather than inaccuracy.

Generally, the GSI-based LiDAR performed well but showed reduced correlation within narrow and vegetated reaches. These differences could be owing to lower point density, coarser vertical resolution, or interpolation effects near water bodies, where LiDAR signals are typically absorbed or reflected by the water surface. In summary, while the RS-DTM had higher MAE and RMSE values in some ranges due to vegetation noise and outliers, it also showed good performance for capturing detailed terrain features of shallow bathymetric and vegetated surfaces that are not represented in the GSI-LiDAR dataset. Thus, despite localized discrepancies, it follows that RS-DTM is a robust, adaptable, and inexpensive alternative for high-resolution terrain representation in flood-prone or data-scarce regions.
