Flooding is a natural disaster that affects all populated continents and is commonly regarded as the most prevalent, widespread, and destructive disaster to have impacted human communities. While floods have the tendency to cause loss of life and property, they are also part of the natural hydrological cycle with ecological and positive effects on society, especially in regions suffering from extended drought. In fact, frequent flooding is vital in maintaining the ecological balance of riverine and coastal wetland ecosystems. With time, human societies have attempted to better understand, analyze, and forecast flood events and effects. To facilitate this, flood inundation models have been extensively constructed and applied. Because floods account for a high percentage of all reported natural disasters worldwide—with that percentage increasing over the past 30 years (Freer et al., 2011)—flood modeling studies have been an international priority. Over the past decades, since the 1970s, scientific advancements have been made with large leaps in improving the efficiency of flood inundation models that are now applied extensively to map flood risk (Apel et al., 2006; Dutta et al., 2006), damage (Merz et al., 2010), real-time forecasting of floods (Arduino et al., 2005), floodplain ecology (Karim et al., 2015), hydrology of river systems (Dutta et al., 2013), and catchment hydrology (Abbott et al., 1986; Beven, 1989).
