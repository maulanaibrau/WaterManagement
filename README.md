Research on satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) has progressed since the 1970s in tandem with advancements in remote sensing technologies (Mavraeidopoulus et al., 2017). Polcyn et al. (1970) presented the first physically based models, which were later improved by Polcyn and Lyzenga (1973), Lyzenga and Polcyn (1976), and Lyzenga (1978). By relating bottom depth to reflectance and taking into consideration light propagation, water attenuation, seabed composition, and biochemical conditions, these early studies developed empirical methods for estimating water depth.

WorldView-2 imagery was used in this study to estimate SDB. A semi-automated multi-scene method based on the wavelength-dependent attenuation of light through the water column was used to determine water depths (Casal et al., 2019; Duan et al., 2022; Stumpf et al., 2003). The log-transformed band ratio model proposed by Stumpf et al. (2003) was first calculated, which uses the ratio of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in the blue and green bands and has been shown to perform reliably at depths up to 25 m (Viana-Borja et al., 2025). For shallow waters (<7 m), an alternative configuration using the ratio of blue to red bands was applied, which has been identified as more suitable for very shallow bathymetry.

The calibrated SDB (in meters) was obtained from a dimensionless pseudo-SDB (pSDB). In this formulation, λi represents the blue band and λj corresponds to either the green or red band, producing pSDBgreen and pSDBred, respectively. The relationship pSDB0 = m0/m1 is algebraically equivalent to the model of Stumpf et al. (2003), where m0 and m1 are calibration coefficients, Rrs is the remote sensing reflectance (sr⁻¹), and n is a fixed constant (set at 1000).
