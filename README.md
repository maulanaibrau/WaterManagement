Several datasets were utilized in this study, including satellite images, InSAR, LiDAR survey data, and LiDAR elevation data supplied by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI). Satellite data were obtained from WorldView-2 on 2 June 2022. InSAR (interferometric wide swath/single look complex) vertical elevation changes were obtained, with the most recent dataset on 25 November 2024. Ground survey was conducted on 21â€“22 November 2024 across a size of approximately 333.75 ha. We surveyed the aerial LiDAR using a DJI Matrice 350 RTK system and processed the LiDAR data according to Takahashi et al. (2005) and Yamamoto (2016) method and software. Additionally, we employed LiDAR-based digital terrain model (DTM) data from GSI (2024), which has a 5 m spatial resolution and 10 cm vertical accuracy, for comparison.
