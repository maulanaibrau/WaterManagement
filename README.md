Topography in steep slope regions exhibits unique characteristics resulting from the complex interaction between geomorphological and hydrological processes. In such terrains, the combination of rapid elevation change, intense erosion, and gravitational mass movements creates highly variable and rugged landforms (Draebing et al, 2025; Hovius and Stark, 2006). The steep gradients accelerate surface runoff (Chen et al, 2022), reduce infiltration (Morbidelli et al, 2018), and influence river morphology (Jiang et al, 2025)—often producing deeply incised, V-shaped valleys with unstable slopes (Burbank and Anderson, 2011; Dietrich and Dunne, 1978; Montgomery and Dietrich, 1992). Consequently, understanding the distinctive characteristics of steep slope topography is essential for accurate hydrological modeling, slope stability assessment, and sustainable land management in mountainous regions. Given the strong control that topography exerts on hydrological processes in steep slope environments, it becomes equally important to conduct detailed flood modeling in these areas. Both physically based flood models (Abbott et al., 1986; Ikhwali et al, 2022; Karim et al., 2015; Rau et al, 2021) and machine learning approaches (Kabir et al, 2020; Karim et al, 2023; Rau et al, 2025; Nevo et al, 2022) have been applied to simulate runoff and flood behavior; however, modeling floods in rural, mountainous, or steep-slope terrains remains particularly challenging. This difficulty arises from the complex terrain and microtopography that govern surface runoff processes (Godara et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2025; Pavlíček and Bruland, 2019). Steep cropland, and terrace rice fields specifically, plays a crucial role in regulating runoff and mitigating flood risk through its function as distributed retention and conveyance systems (Nohara and Yamada, 2022; Chen et al, 2017). However, accurately modeling hydrological processes in these landscapes requires detailed representation of the topographic features, especially the numerous small channels that regulate flow within the areas. Therefore, acquiring precise elevation and channel geometry data is essential. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are fundamental datasets for flood modeling. Free DEMs like SRTM (Zyl, 2001), ASTER GDEM (Yamaguchi et al, 1998), and ALOS PALSAR (Kimura and Ito, 2000) are available to anyone; however, these are of low resolution and cannot be used for complex, steep terrains. High-resolution elevation data from light detection and ranging-LiDAR (Lefsky et al., 2002), or ground surveys, may provide the required accuracy-as noted by Kumar et al. (2023)-but these are usually impracticable owing to high costs and logistical challenges over extensive and inaccessible countryside areas. Satellite-derived DTMs, or RS-DTMs, offer an important avenue for filling this knowledge gap. They hold the prospect of combining large-area coverage and high-resolution terrain modeling with minimal fieldwork input. Their potential has already been proven in a series of current studies on lowland flood modeling-Rau et al. (2024)-and their ability to represent small-scale hydrological details remains largely unexplored. In fact, the small-scale irrigation and drainage ditches in sloping cropland represent one of the significant gaps in knowledge. This work aims to test the topographic fidelity and channel reproducibility of RS-DTM in steep slope agricultural land. A comparison of RS-DTMs, free LiDAR data from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan-GSI-GSI (2020)-and very accurate surveyed UAV-based LiDAR data serving as the reference-is performed in this paper. By placing emphasis on channel geometry representation, this research aims to contribute to an improved knowledge of how remotely sensed elevation data can act as trusted stand-ins to detailed topographic surveys in steep-slope regions.
