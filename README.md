According to the cross-sectional area analysis, RS-DTM estimates closely match survey-LiDAR estimates for narrow channels with widths of 0.5–1.0 m and 1.0–2.0 m.  However, RS-DTM shows more cross-sectional area variability in the 2.0–3.0 m width range; GSI-LiDAR values typically fall outside of this range.  Due to the influence of the SDB method, RS-DTM typically yields larger cross-sectional areas than survey-LiDAR for wider channels of 3.0–5.0 m.  However, the lack of bathymetric detail in GSI-LiDAR data within this width range limits the realibility to represent channel geometry.
