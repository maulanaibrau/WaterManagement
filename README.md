Topography is one of the most critical inputs to hydrodynamic and flood inundation modeling, as it defines slope, flow paths, and storage capacity of the terrain that directly influences the movement of water and flood extent. Small vertical differences in elevation can lead to serious changes in simulated flow velocity, inundation depth, and spatial flood distribution, particularly in low-gradient river systems and deltaic regions. Comparing the RS-DTM and LiDAR-based elevation models, the study shows that RS-DTM can reproduce terrain elevation patterns with comparable accuracy to that achieved by LiDAR, especially in those areas with narrow and shallow channels. This suggests that RS-DTM is capable of maintaining sufficient topographic precision to support reliable hydraulic and hydrological simulations.

This has considerable practical implications. Traditional LiDAR surveys are very accurate but expensive, logistically demanding, and often spatially limited, especially within developing or data-scarce regions. The capability of RS-DTM to approximate LiDAR-grade topographic detail through freely available or lower-cost satellite imagery might reduce the dependency on large-scale field campaigns and survey budgets. Furthermore, the integration of bathymetric information in RS-DTM is an additional advantage for flood modeling, which better represents the channel cross-section and flow conveyance capacity. This suggests a promising direction for developing efficient, scalable, and cost-effective flood modeling frameworks in cases when LiDAR data are not accessible.
