This study compared the topographic fidelity and channel representation capability of satellite-derived digital terrain models with GSI-based and UAV survey LiDAR data in steep-slope agricultural areas. The result revealed that RS-DTM can achieve accuracy and consistency comparable to LiDAR, particularly for narrow channels ≤ 3 m, where R² and NSE consistently exceeded 0.9. Although some reaches demonstrated higher MAE and RMSE values due to vegetation interference and localized outliers, RS-DTM captured terrain and shallow bathymetric variations not represented by conventional LiDAR datasets. Therefore, the findings herein prove that RS-DTM is a capable and cost-effective alternative for the creation of high-resolution elevation data with less dependence on extensive field surveys, for improving flood and hydrologic modeling in regions with limited or unavailable LiDAR data.
