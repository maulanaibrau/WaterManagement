This study evaluated the topographic fidelity and channel representation capability of satellite-derived digital terrain models (RS-DTMs) in comparison with GSI-based and UAV survey LiDAR data in steep-slope agricultural regions. The results demonstrated that RS-DTM can achieve accuracy and consistency comparable to LiDAR, particularly for narrow channels (≤3 m), where R² and NSE consistently exceeded 0.9. Although higher MAE and RMSE values were observed in some sections due to vegetation interference and localized outliers, the RS-DTM effectively captured terrain and shallow bathymetric variations that conventional LiDAR datasets could not represent. These findings confirm that RS-DTM offers a reliable and cost-efficient alternative for generating high-resolution elevation data, reducing dependence on extensive field surveys, and enhancing flood and hydrological modeling in regions where LiDAR data are limited or unavailable.
