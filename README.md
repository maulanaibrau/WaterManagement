Several datasets were utilized in this study, including satellite images, InSAR, LiDAR survey data, and LiDAR elevation data supplied by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI). Satellite data were obtained from WorldView-2 on 2 June 2022. InSAR (interferometric wide swath/single look complex) vertical elevation changes were obtained, with the most recent dataset on 25 November 2024. Ground survey was conducted on 21â€“22 November 2024 across a size of approximately 333.75 ha.  Aerial LiDAR data were collected using a DJI Matrice 350 RTK system, and the drone generally flew at a height of ~100 m, but flights at lower heights (~10 m) were conducted in certain channel reaches in order to increase data resolution. The LiDAR data were processed following the methodology and software developed by Takahashi et al. (2005) and Yamamoto (2016). The survey LiDAR data was used as the reference (observed) data to be compared with the RS-DTM and GSI LiDAR data since it was considered to have the highest vertical accuracy and spatial resolution of approximately 20 cm.
