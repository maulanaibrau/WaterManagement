Discharge hydrograph indicates that RS-DTM-based model overestimated the peak discharge slightly compared to the survey-based LiDAR. Conversely, GSI-LiDAR-based model underpinned the peak compared to the survey-LiDAR data. For the model performance, the RS-DTM was slightly better than GSI-LiDAR with Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.98 and 0.97 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 0.46 and 0.38, respectively.
For the water level at the most downstream location, the RS-DTM results were more similar in general pattern to the survey-LiDAR data, although the highest water level was more different than that for the GSI-LiDAR. Alternatively, the GSI-LiDAR results showed less similarity with the survey-LiDAR, particularly during low flow, with GSI-LiDAR predicting higher water levels. Value of NSE and RMSE of water level at this location were 0.99 and 0.15 for RS-DTM, and 0.80 and 0.19 for GSI-LiDAR, respectively.

For peak water level along the longitudinal profile of the main drainage system, RS-DTM produced relatively higher values than GSI-LiDAR. Values of NSE of RS-DTM and GSI-LiDAR were 0.99 and 0.98, respectively, while both data sets produced equal RMSE of 7.01 m.

For the inundation depth, the less than 0.01 m depth areas were uniform for all DTM sources. However, the survey-LiDAR revealed the highest inundated area for 0.01–0.02 m depth, followed by RS-DTM, and GSI-LiDAR. For 0.2–0.4 m and 0.4–0.6 m depths, the RS-DTM values were closer to those of survey-LiDAR. At depths greater than 0.6 m, RS-DTM provided the highest inundation area. The NSE values between RS-DTM and GSI-LiDAR were very variable, at 0.95 and 0.65, respectively.

The trend of general inundation volume showed that RS-DTM results were more similar to the survey-LiDAR than the GSI-LiDAR, albeit the peak volume varying by some 7.6 × 10³ m³. The same overall tendency to be closer to, and even greater than, the survey-LiDAR than the GSI-LiDAR prevailed for all flow conditions and for all time intervals. The NSE and RMSE for inundation volume were 0.86 and 2.39 × 10³ m³ for RS-DTM, and 0.84 and 5.10 × 10³ m³ for GSI-LiDAR, respectively.

Discrepancies in the flood simulations from RS-DTM, GSI-LiDAR, and survey-LiDAR could be explained primarily because of variability in data acquisition time, spatial resolution, and surface modeling. The RS-DTM was extracted using WorldView-2 satellite images with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m captured in June 2022, when vegetation on terrace paddy fields and drainage channels was lush. Thus, partial elevation overestimation in the resulting terrain model, particularly near vegetated or shaded areas, was probable due to noise from vegetation. This effect is characteristic of optical stereo image-based satellite DTMs, where the canopy and surface features can be partially unresolved even after filtering. The survey-LiDAR data, by contrast, were recorded in November 2024, when vegetation was low, hence more accurate ground detection. The national surveying agency delivered the GSI-LiDAR data, which had been obtained some years before with coarser resolution and lower point density and were not able to capture small-scale topography and narrow drainage features as well.

The peak discharge overestimation by the model from RS-DTM is also what might be anticipated from the impact of terrain elevation error due to vegetation. Overestimated ground levels in channel proximity reduce the effective cross-sectional area, which raises flow velocity and results in a more steeply peaked discharge. Furthermore, localized roughness in the RS-DTM might have altered flow routes, routing runoff to the main drainage system. In contrast, the underestimation visible in the GSI-LiDAR estimates likely stems from its smoother terrain and reduced representation of small depressions and microchannels that can disperse or slow flow, leading to reduced peak discharges. This pattern highlights how both vertical accuracy and surface detail can have a substantial influence on flood hydrograph performance.

The downstream water level patterns also reflect such topographic effects. The RS-DTM showed a roughly analogous trend to the survey-LiDAR but with higher peak magnitudes. This behavior suggests that overestimations in small terrain upstream propagated downstream, inflating flood peaks without significantly altering timing of flow. The GSI-LiDAR, meanwhile, had larger water levels for low-flow events, perhaps indicating artificial basins in its smoothed surface, causing local sinks and retaining water. These differences suggest that the more coarse datasets distort storage and conveyance behavior in small-scale drainage systems.

Likewise, throughout the longitudinal profile, the somewhat higher simulated water levels of RS-DTM also comport with vegetation artifact and local error influences on elevation. Vegetation or residual surface roughness of the June 2022 image might have contributed to the discernable bed elevation of narrow channels, thereby raising simulated water surfaces. At the same time, GSI-LiDAR's smoothing added less variability in the terrain along the drainage path and is responsible for its more uniform but slightly lower water levels. Despite such variations, both datasets were still highly consistent with survey-LiDAR, suggesting that their large-scale drainage gradients were still well represented.

The observed inundation depth distributions describe how DTM characteristics control localized floodplain behavior. The RS-DTM performed superior concordance with survey-LiDAR for moderate depth ranges (0.2–0.6 m), which means while there were lingering impacts of vegetation, its high resolution preserved significant microtopographic features fundamental to surface flow dispersion. But for deeper flooding (>0.6 m), RS-DTM overestimated, consistent with elevated ground surface levels near channels which reduce conveyance capacity and result in artificial ponding. The GSI-LiDAR underestimated inundation area in the majority of categories of depth. This is due to the removal of minidepressions and drainage anomalies by terrain smoothing, which limits floodwater expansion over low-relief surfaces.

That the RS-DTM and survey-LiDAR inundation volume trends are largely consistent means that despite its satellite-ground realization nature, the RS-DTM more accurately reflected the hydrological connectivity of the floodplain than the GSI-LiDAR. The moderate overestimation of peak volume (~7.6 × 10³ m³) is consistent with the summative effect of elevation errors caused by vegetation that constrained flow and increased temporary storage. In contrast, the underestimation of overall inundation volume by GSI-LiDAR is equivalent to insufficient information in channel geometry and storage areas. These findings altogether illustrate that although satellite-based DTMs may approximate the capability of drone-based LiDAR in flood modeling, their accuracy is still sensitive to vegetation status and image acquisition timing.
