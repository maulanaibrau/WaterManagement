Both longitudinal and cross sections were analyzed using error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and performance metrics (R² and NSE). The results show that R² and NSE generally decrease as river width increases. This decline is associated with reduced correlation in widths greater than approximately 3 m, where SDB influences the RS-DTM results, while survey-based LiDAR and GSI-LiDAR did not capture such conditions. On the other hand, topographic features dominated narrow channels, where SDB had no effect.
Errors occurred more randomly in both longitudinal and cross sections, and the error metrics did not show a consistent trend with river width.  The river width of 1-2 meters had the highest RMSE of RS-DTM for the longitudinal section, whilst the RMSE of GSI-LiDAR peaked at 1-2 meters for the cross section.  In the longitudinal section, RS-DTM may have been affected by residual vegetation cover that was not fully eliminated, whereas in the cross section, GSI-LiDAR was less capable of replicating channel geometry due to its relatively coarse 5 m spatial resolution.
