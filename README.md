Examination of longitudinal profiles reveals that RS-DTM overestimates elevations compared to survey-based LiDAR for river widths of 0.5 m to 2.0 m, although some sections are in better agreement. Compared to the GSI-LiDAR, the RS-DTM is better correlated overall. For river widths over 2.0 m, the RS-DTM continues to overestimate in comparison to the survey-LiDAR, but at widths near 3 m and above, the RS-DTM begins to underestimate terrain heights. Overestimation for channels with widths under 2 m is likely caused by the inability to remove vegetation and surface features entirely during DSM to DTM conversion. Conversely, underestimation in reaches wider than ~3 m is associated with the transition from terrain to bathymetric conditions because bathymetric effects are presumed after this point. In such cases, surface water detection is influenced by backscatter from water surfaces that are mapped utilizing satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB).

The longitudinal section analysis indicates that the RS-DTM generally overestimates elevations compared to the survey-based LiDAR for river widths between 0.5 m and 2.0 m, although certain segments show closer agreement. When compared with the GSI-LiDAR, the RS-DTM exhibits stronger overall correlation. For river widths exceeding 2.0 m, the RS-DTM continues to show an overestimation relative to the survey-LiDAR; however, at widths approaching 3 m and above, the RS-DTM begins to underestimate terrain elevations. The overestimation observed in channels narrower than 2 m is likely attributable to incomplete removal of vegetation and surface features during the conversion from DSM to DTM. Conversely, the underestimation observed in reaches wider than ~3 m is associated with the transition from terrain to bathymetric conditions, as bathymetric effects are considered beyond this threshold. In such cases, surface water detection is influenced by backscatter from water surfaces, which is captured through satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB).
