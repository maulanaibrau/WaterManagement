Results

Comparative assessment between RS-DTM and GSI-based LiDAR with the reference LiDAR survey generally showed a strong agreement for all cross and longitudinal sections assessed. For both datasets, the statistical indices assessed (MAE, RMSE, R², and NSE) demonstrated good consistency, and RS-DTM results were often comparable or superior compared to GSI-based LiDAR data.

For cross-sectional profiles, RS-DTM obtained lower or comparable error metrics across the majority of river width classes. In narrow channels (0.5–1 m), RS-DTM gave an MAE of 0.98 m and RMSE of 1.24 m, closely matching GSI-LiDAR (0.68 m and 1.34 m), with both demonstrating excellent correlations (R² = 0.99 and NSE = 0.97). With the increase in the river's width, RS-DTM produced stable performance. For example, within the 1–2 and 2–3 m classes, RS-DTM had consistently higher R² (0.96–0.94) and NSE (0.92–0.95) than GSI-LiDAR (0.91–0.89 for R² and 0.88–0.90 for NSE, respectively). Even at the 3–5 m class, RS-DTM still produced a reasonable correlation, R² of 0.79 and NSE of 0.65, though the MAE and RMSE were higher at 1.7 and 2.75 m, respectively, compared to the GSI-LiDAR with an R² of 0.85 and NSE of 0.61.

A similar trend was seen in the longitudinal profiles, where the RS-DTM showed stronger or comparable predictive accuracy. For the narrower channels (0.5-1 m), RS-DTM reached R² = 0.99 and NSE = 0.98, similar to GSI-LiDAR (R² = 0.98, NSE = 0.97). At intermediate widths (1-2 m, 2-3 m), RS-DTM showed higher model performance, with R² and NSE values up to 0.97 and 0.87, respectively, compared to 0.94 and 0.88 for GSI-LiDAR. In wider channels (3-5 m), RS-DTM still retained a fair correlation (R² = 0.61, NSE = 0.38) versus GSI-LiDAR at 0.77 and 0.65, respectively. Despite lowered accuracy within this range, the RS-DTM results have captured more terrain variability than the GSI-LiDAR dataset did.

On the whole, RS-DTM performed quite well for the different classes of river width, with R² ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 and NSE from 0.87 to 0.98 under most conditions. Slightly worse performance in channels within a width range of 3-5 m reveals model sensitivity to more complex bathymetric and vegetative conditions, which will be discussed in the following section.

Discussion

Several factors may explain why RS-DTM outperforms or performs equally well compared to GSI-based LiDAR: First, RS-DTM included the estimation of bathymetry by the SDB approach that allowed partial submerged terrain features to be detected. This likely improved topographic continuity at river widths around 2-3 m, therefore yielding high R² (0.94-0.95) and NSE (0.92-0.95) at these scales. For larger channels, however (3-5 m), accuracy declined with R² = 0.79 and 0.61; NSE = 0.65 and 0.38 in the cross and longitudinal sections, respectively, likely as a result of limits to optical penetration depth and increased heterogeneity of the riverbed in deeper reaches.

The higher MAE that occurred in narrow channels, for example, 0.5-1 m with an MAE of 0.98 m, can be explained by vegetation interference and mixed-pixel effects in RS-DTM acquisition in June 2022 when the vegetation cover was dense. However, this reference LiDAR survey was conducted in November 2024 during low vegetation conditions, thus allowing more distinct ground detection. Therefore, some vertical bias in RS-DTM data actually comes from canopy interference, especially along vegetated or shaded channel margins.

The GSI-based LiDAR, while generally very accurate, showed some degradation in performance across the dataset. Again, this may be due to differences between data resolution, acquisition geometry, and the point density of that used in the site-specific LiDAR survey used for benchmarking. In summary, the RS-DTM was not only in strong agreement with the high-accuracy LiDAR survey data, but also proved capable of adapting to subaqueous and vegetated topography. While there were localized errors both in narrow and wide channels, overall performance—especially over intermediate river widths—proved that remote-sensing-based DTM generation can provide a reliable and cost-efficient alternative to traditional LiDAR-based terrain mapping.
